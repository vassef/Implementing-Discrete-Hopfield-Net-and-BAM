# Implementing-Discrete-Hopfield-Net-and-BAM
## Abstract:
This repository is mainly about Image Reconstruction using Discrete Hopfield Net and Implementing Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) networks.
## Hopfield Net :
The Hopfield Net succeed in reconstructing images by remembering abstract details. A case in point is a ghost sticker, which is modified by removing one forth of its whole pattern:
